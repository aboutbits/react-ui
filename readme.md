# React-UI

React UI is a very opinionated design library, that is based on React and TailwindCSS.
The build in theming solution, allows you to change the look and feel of all components.

Discover further details about this design library on our [homepage](https://storybook.aboutbits.it/).

## Usage

First, you have to install the package:

```
npm install @aboutbits/react-ui
```

You can use the `tailwind-preset.js` file as preset in your project's `tailwind.config.js`to load the default colors.

Further documentation of each component can be found [here](https://storybook.aboutbits.it/).

**Hint**: If you're using Next.js or Webpack in your project, you can use the [ReactUI integrations](https://github.com/aboutbits/react-ui-integrations) to easily integrate ReactUI.

## Contribute

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing
purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com)

### Setup

Install all dependencies by executing the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

Next, you can start the application:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The project will be served at http://localhost:4000.

Generate a static build by executing the following command:

```bash
npm run build-storybook
```
## Learn more

To learn more about Storybook, take a look at the following resource:

- [StoryBook Documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction)


## Development

For linting the source files, execute the following command:

```bash
npm run lint

# or

npm run lint:fix
```

For type checking, execute the following command:

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

For running the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
npm run test

#or

npm run test:watch
```

### Docker Environment

If you want to get up and running without installing all special requirements of the project locally on your machine, you can follow these steps to set up a preconfigured Docker environment.

This environment has also the advantage, that it serves the application with a custom domain name and through HTTPS with valid SSL certificate.

#### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) / [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/) / [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Local Docker Environment](https://github.com/aboutbits/local-environment)

#### Setup

Install all dependencies by executing the following command:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm node npm install
```

To start the Docker containers, execute the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up --detach

# or if you want to force a rebuild of the containers

docker-compose build --pull
docker-compose up --detach
```

The project will be served at https://web.aboutbits.test.

Afterwards, you can stop the containers using the following command:

```bash
docker-compose stop

# or if you want to stop and delete the containers

docker-compose down
```

## Build & Publish

To build and publish the package, simply commit all changes and push them to master. Then run one of the following commands locally:

```bash
npm version patch
npm version minor
npm version major
```
