# Actions

The `Actions` component positions children in a flex container.
It makes sure that there is space between each item and that they stack on mobile.
This is very handy in a content area or a dialog, where you have two buttons next to each other.

export const Template = ({ children, ...args }) => (
  <Actions {...args}>{children}</Actions>
)

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Default" args={{ children: <Button>Button 1</Button> }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Props

<ArgsTable story="Default" />

### Theme

- `action.action.base`: Define the flexbox and the spacing between the children of the content area.
- `action.action.variant.start`: Define left position of children of the content area.
- `action.action.variant.center`: Define center position of children of the content area.
- `action.action.variant.end`: Define right position of children of the content area.

## Multiple children

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Multiple children">
    <Actions>
      <Button>Button 1</Button>
      <Button>Button 2</Button>
    </Actions>
  </Story>
</Canvas>
