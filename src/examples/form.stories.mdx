# Form

The following example shows how a potential form could look like.

`React Hook Form` is used to handle the form.

`yup` is used as schema validator with the `yupResolver` from `@hookform/resolvers`.

```
npm install react-hook-form @hookform/resolvers yup
```

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Default" argTypes={{ onSubmit: { control: false } }}>
    {FormExampleTemplate.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
